# AGENTS.md

Quick orientation for agents working on this repo. Read this before exploring; it captures the architecture and key facts.

## What this is

`pr-monitor` is a GitHub PR watcher that posts factual status updates back into the owning agent session. It is **dual-target**: an **opencode plugin** (`opencode/`) and a **Claude Code plugin** (`claude-code/`), both built on the same core (`core/`) and session runtime (`runtime/`).

## Project layout

One directory per target, plus shared core and runtime layers. Dependency flows
adapter → `runtime/` → `core/`; **`core/` imports nothing from a shell**.
Adapters own delivery/lifecycle/config paths, not watch orchestration.

```
core/                # Pure per-PR state, GitHub normalization, reports, config types/loading.
  config.ts    # Common MonitorConfig plus ClaudeMonitorConfig; permissive first-readable loading.
  target.ts    # Parses PR target: "owner/repo#n" or full GitHub URL.
  github.ts    # GraphQL polling via injected GhRunner; normalizes into PrSnapshot.
  activity.ts  # detectActivity(prev, next): what counts as a change.
  watch.ts     # PrWatch — per-PR state machine (tick, debounce, deliver); no session ownership.
  report.ts    # Markdown report rendering.
  label.ts     # mark_ready / unmark_ready: add or remove the readyLabel via gh REST.

  commands/          # /pr-monitor:watch, /pr-monitor:status, /pr-monitor:ready, /pr-monitor:unready
  .mcp.json          # declares the MCP server (node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/mcp-server.mjs) — plugin-root convention.
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json      # plugin metadata only (name/version/description/...); components are discovered by convention
                     # (.mcp.json, hooks/hooks.json, commands/) — an inline mcpServers field here is NOT picked up (tested on 2.1.216).
  dist/
    mcp-server.mjs   # committed esbuild bundle (plugin installs run NO build step — rebuild + commit on change).

.claude-plugin/
  marketplace.json # MUST stay at the repo root — `/plugin marketplace add <repo>` reads it from there.
                   # Its plugin entry points at the plugin root with "source": "./claude-code";
                   # relative sources resolve against the directory containing .claude-plugin/.
```

Everything under `claude-code/` is addressed plugin-root-relative at runtime, so
`.mcp.json` and `hooks.json` (which use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`) are unaffected by
where the plugin root sits in the repo.

## Core flow (both shells)

1. **start** — adapter calls its session's `MonitorSession` → parse/dedupe → load config/auth → fetch initial snapshot → reject if not `OPEN` → `new PrWatch(...)` → arm the owned interval.
2. **tick** — `PrWatch.tick()` (`core/watch.ts`): fetch snapshot → `detectActivity` → mark dirty/reset debounce → check immediate events (new CI failure, conflict, merge/close) → mark urgent → `maybeAutoFlush()`.
3. **deliver** — shell-specific, injected as `deps.deliver`:
   - opencode (`opencode/index.ts`): `client.session.promptAsync(...)` pushes a `[PR Monitor]` message into the owning session. `promptAsync` never rejects on server error — check `result.error`. `agent` captured at start time (default agent may be a subagent, which fails); model captured per-message via the `chat.message` hook.
   - Claude Code (`claude-code/src/mcp-server.ts`): `spoolReport()` writes one file per report under `~/.claude/pr-monitor/spool/<claude pid>/`; the plugin's hooks inject spooled text at the next UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse / Stop event (Stop blocks turn-end so pending reports are addressed). Claude Code has no push channel into a session, so delivery itself is passive by necessity; the keep-alive loop (below) is what stops that mattering while a PR is still in flight.

## Key behaviors / gotchas

- **Debounce + CI-hold** in `maybeAutoFlush` (`core/watch.ts`): wait `debounceMinutes` of quiet after ordinary activity; if CI is running on an OPEN PR, hold up to `maxCiWaitMinutes` before flushing.
- **Immediate flushes** bypass both timers. A new CI failure (when `config.flushOnCiFailure` is on), newly observed merge conflict, or terminal state marks the watch `urgent`; `maybeAutoFlush` sends the report at that poll. `hasNewCiFailure(prev, next)` is capped by `ciFailureFlushedSha` to one instant failure report per head commit; later failures ride with the suite-conclusion report. A delivery failure restores urgency so it retries immediately.
- **detectActivity** (`core/activity.ts`): state, mergeable, reviews, per-thread resolution/visible-comment signatures, issue comments, and CI **conclusion** count as activity. Review comments retain thread identity and current resolution state, allowing reports to distinguish follow-ups on resolved versus unresolved threads; ignored tagged replies are absent from those signatures. CI transitions into "running" and non-failing per-check progress do **NOT** count. Mergeability is compared against the last *definite* (MERGEABLE/CONFLICTING) value so transient `UNKNOWN` churn stays quiet while a real `MERGEABLE -> UNKNOWN -> CONFLICTING` settle is caught and flushed immediately.
- **Failure handling** — notFound → stop with notice; 10 consecutive poll failures → stop; 10 consecutive delivery failures → stop. Delivery failures roll back the baseline so the same activity is retried. A failed initial announcement keeps its zero baseline, marks the watch urgent, and retries the complete startup report at the next poll.
- **Reentrancy guard** — `runExclusive` (per-watch promise queue) serializes `tick()` and `manualFlush()` so overlapping fetches can't apply out of order; ticks skip while an op is pending, manual flushes queue. Auto-flush delivery is **awaited inside** that op, not fire-and-forget: its failure path rolls back exactly the state a later flush advances (`lastFlushAt`, `lastFlushedSnapshot`, `dirty`, `holdStartedAt`, `urgent`), so a late rejection from an overlapping delivery would otherwise rewind a newer report's baseline and re-fire it immediately. Comment "new since" comparisons use IDs from `lastFlushedSnapshot`, avoiding GitHub's second-granularity timestamp race. Ticks skipping while a report is in flight is the intended consequence. `tick` also re-checks `stopped` after its awaited fetch so a concurrent `stop()` prevents any late apply/deliver.
- **Sessions, Claude Code shell**: one MCP server process per Claude Code process, so the watches map IS the session scope. Monitors survive `/clear` (same process) and die with the process. Spool routing: spool dirs are named by the owning Claude Code pid (= MCP server's ppid); the hook drains dirs named by its parent/grandparent pid (hook ← sh ← claude; deliberately NOT the full ancestry, which would let a nested claude session steal the outer session's reports) and GCs dead-pid dirs. Ancestry is read from `/proc` where it exists, else `ps`; with neither the hook drains **nothing** — the number of live spools is not evidence of ownership (a session with no monitor still fires hooks), so there is no cardinality trick that substitutes for real ancestry. A pid is not an identity either — the OS recycles them — so `claimSpool` records the Claude Code process's start time in `<spool dir>/owner` (tmp+rename; a torn read must not look like a foreign token) at server startup, and it is enforced in three places: the server discards anything it cannot prove it inherited before spooling (a foreign token *and* an untokened dir, since stamping the latter would launder a vanished session's reports); `spoolReport` re-checks the token before every write, so an orphaned server whose parent's pid got recycled cannot write into the newcomer's spool; the hook *skips* — never deletes — a dir whose token mismatches, because deleting would race the newcomer's `claimSpool`. On macOS the token is `ps -o lstart=` (1-second resolution), a deliberate residue: coarser than ideal, but calling macOS unverifiable would restore pid-only routing there, which is strictly worse. Report filenames carry the *server* pid too (`seq` restarts at 0 in each process while the dir outlives them, so an /mcp restart could otherwise collide within a millisecond and lose a report). Drains claim each report via unlink-before-emit so concurrent hook invocations never deliver one twice, and the script must not process.exit after writing (stdout past the 64KB pipe buffer would be truncated). PostToolUse also fires for tool calls inside Task subagents — those hook inputs carry `agent_id`, and drain-spool.mjs skips them so a report is never consumed by a subagent's context (verified empirically on Claude Code 2.1.216). Shutdown (stdin EOF/SIGTERM) spools a `Monitor stopped` notice per watch — delivered if the same process continues (server restart), silently GC'd if the session is gone.
- **Reload takeover, opencode shell** — `globalThis.__sesoriPrMonitorTakeovers` kills zombie timers from prior plugin instances; old watches send one factual stop notice. (`session.deleted` stops matching watches silently.) Graceful `dispose` cannot use `promptAsync`: OpenCode acknowledges that endpoint before its fork persists the message, then disposal cancels the fork. Shutdown uses synchronous `session.prompt` with `noReply: true`, persisting each notice before disposal without starting a model turn.
- Reports are **facts only**: counts and authors, never comment bodies or advice.
- **The monitor owns waiting.** Tool descriptions and the Claude skill forbid agent-created sleeps, scheduled checks, background polling, repeated `gh pr checks`, and routine `status`/`flush`. Claude may run only the exact `await-activity.mjs` command supplied by a keep-alive message.
- **mark_ready / unmark_ready** (both shells, `core/label.ts`) — add/remove `config.readyLabel` (default `ready-for-human-review`) via the gh REST API. Both verify the target via `pulls/{n}` first and refuse non-open targets (`assertOpenPullRequest`) — the labels endpoints operate on the shared issue namespace, so a plain issue number or merged/closed PR would otherwise be labeled with a false success. `mark_ready` pre-creates the label (green, described) because the add endpoint auto-creates missing labels as grey/undescribed; that create call's failure (usually 422 already_exists) is swallowed, the add call fails loudly. `unmark_ready` treats a 404 from the delete as success (the PR simply did not carry the label). Standalone: neither needs an active monitor.
- **Keep-alive loop, Claude Code shell** — the answer to "Claude Code has no push channel": while a monitored PR is not handed off, the Stop hook refuses turn-end and hands the session a Bash command running `claude-code/hooks/await-activity.mjs`, which blocks until a report is spooled. One model round trip per real event, not per poll. Wiring: `claude-code/src/session-state.ts` publishes `{keepAlive, expiresAtMs, keepAliveUntilMs, monitors}` to `<spool dir>/session.json`; the MCP server rewrites it on every watch-set/handoff change **and after every poll tick** (the tick rewrite is the liveness heartbeat — `expiresAtMs` lapsing is how the hooks learn the server died). `keepAliveUntilMs` is the rolling *idle* cap (`keepAliveMaxMinutes`), refreshed by every delivery, so work is unbounded but silence is not. `mark_ready` adds the target to the in-memory `handedOff` set (monitoring continues, but it no longer holds the session) — but **only when a watch for it exists**, since a stale entry would silently disable keep-alive for a monitor started later under the same key; any later delivery for that target removes it again — new activity on a handed-off PR is exactly the human feedback the loop exists to catch. The waiter never unlinks reports: it only detects that one exists, and the PostToolUse drain that fires when it exits does the exactly-once delivery. `drain-spool.mjs` bounds a tight Stop loop by counting *blocks that produced no wait* (`.keepalive` holds `{at, streak}`; `await-activity.mjs` stamps `.waiter` when a wait completes, which resets the streak; give up at 5). Counting waits rather than elapsed time is the point — a wall-clock gap cannot tell a broken waiter from a session that legitimately ran a quick tool before ending its turn, and treating the second as the first abandons a PR still being worked. The waiter path is single-quoted into that Bash command (`shellQuote`), since a plugin can be installed under any path and `$(...)` inside double quotes would be expanded by the shell before node starts. Labels are reported (`- Labels:` in `buildReport`) but deliberately excluded from `detectActivity` — the agent applies the label itself, and counting it as activity would make every `mark_ready` deliver a report that immediately re-opens the loop.

## Configuration

`pr-monitor.json`, loaded fresh per start/action: all adapters first look for repository `.pr-monitor.json`. OpenCode then falls back to `<directory>/.opencode/` and `<worktree>/.opencode/`; Claude Code falls back to `<project>/.claude/`, then `.opencode/`. `MonitorConfig` contains common settings; `ClaudeMonitorConfig` adds `desktopNotifications`, `keepAlive`, and `keepAliveMaxMinutes`. Loading is permissive: unknown keys ignored, invalid values dropped, invalid JSON logged, missing file → defaults.

## GitHub layer

- Injected `GhRunner`: OpenCode wraps Bun `$` in `opencode/gh.ts`; Node adapters use `runtime/node-gh.ts`. Both throw `PollError(msg, { notFound })` on failure; `core/github.ts` imports neither host.
- `PR_QUERY` (`core/github.ts`) fetches title, url, state, mergeable, head SHA, latest commit's check rollup, review requests/latestReviews, the first review-thread page + comments, issue comment count, and labels. `REVIEW_THREADS_PAGE_QUERY` fetches every remaining thread page only when the connection exceeds 100, so follow-ups cannot disappear beyond the first page.
- `normalizeSnapshot` → `PrSnapshot`; `ciPhase` → `none|running|concluded`.

## Building / releasing

- `npm run typecheck` covers `core/`, `runtime/`, `opencode/`, `claude-code/src/`, and `test/`. `npm run build` bundles `claude-code/src/mcp-server.ts` → `claude-code/dist/mcp-server.mjs` (esbuild, ESM, node18 target, createRequire banner for CJS deps). **`claude-code/dist/` is committed** — Claude Code plugin installs copy files and run no build, so rebuild + commit whenever `claude-code/src/` or `core/` changes. The bundle is marked `linguist-generated` in `.gitattributes` so it collapses in GitHub diffs; review the sources, not the bundle.
- `claude-code/hooks/drain-spool.mjs` and `claude-code/hooks/await-activity.mjs` must stay dependency-free (node builtins only) and keep their path/format schemes in sync with `claude-code/src/spool.ts` and `claude-code/src/session-state.ts`. They are shipped as source, not bundled — only `claude-code/src/` goes through esbuild.
- `claude-code/skills/monitor-pr/SKILL.md` ships with the Claude Code plugin (discovered by convention, like `commands/`). It is the *behavior* layer: changing what the loop does usually means editing it, not the TypeScript. opencode does not load plugin-shipped skills — the equivalent there lives in the consuming repo's `.opencode/skills/`.
- A release uses one version for both targets. The root package publishes the OpenCode target as public npm package `@sesori/pr-monitor-opencode` (the transitional source allowlist ships `core/` + `runtime/` + `opencode/`), while an annotated `vX.Y.Z` Git tag releases the Claude Code target. Before releasing: update `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`; run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run pack:check`; commit the rebuilt bundle; then, from a clean release commit on `main`, run `npm publish`, create the local tag, and push the tag only after publication succeeds.

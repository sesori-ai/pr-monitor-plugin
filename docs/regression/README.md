# PR Monitor Regression Testing

This directory is the durable source of truth for agent-run regression testing in this repository. Feature files
state fixed behavior and required boundaries while allowing the executor to vary fixtures, order, and tools.
Production code and released host behavior remain authoritative when documentation drifts.

## Levels

| Level | Name | Required confidence |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Smoke | Critical modules load and the shortest product heartbeat works. |
| L2 | Routine | Important normal and deterministic failure behavior passes at its owning boundary. |
| L3 | Release | Critical user journeys pass through every changed production adapter or artifact. |
| L4 | Extended | Lifecycle, concurrency, recovery, compatibility, and required platform variants pass. |
| L5 | Full | The complete documented matrix passes, including packaged artifacts and external services. |

Levels are cumulative. A requested L4 run includes all applicable L1-L4 requirements. A feature may begin at any
level. A higher-boundary check may satisfy a lower-boundary invariant once when it proves the complete same claim.
Missing infrastructure is `Blocked`, not inapplicable, when the plan or feature document requires that boundary.

## Proof Boundaries

Use the shortest boundary that observes the complete invariant:

| Boundary | Appropriate use |
|---|---|
| Automated | Pure state, parsing, report rendering, deterministic timing, and error rollback. |
| Adapter contract | Host API registration, delivery options, session ownership, and lifecycle using controlled fakes. |
| Actual host | A real OpenCode, Claude Code, Pi, or OMP loader/session must interpret or deliver the behavior. |
| Packaged or external | npm/Git installation, release contents, GitHub, or another production service is part of the claim. |

A source import does not prove a packed artifact. A fake host does not prove actual loader compatibility. One host
or platform proves only that matrix row unless the owning feature document explicitly names it representative.

## Matrix Vocabulary

Every required row names the dimensions that affect its claim:

- **boundary:** automated, adapter contract, actual host, or packaged/external;
- **artifact:** source tree, generated bundle, npm tarball/install, or Claude Git plugin root;
- **host/version:** OpenCode, Claude Code, Pi, OMP, GitHub CLI, and every minimum/current version the feature names;
- **platform/runtime:** operating system plus Node/Bun/host runtime where behavior can differ;
- **variation:** normal, failure, lifecycle, race, recovery, trust, config, or compatibility path; and
- **external fixture:** disposable GitHub repository/PR, authenticated identity, labels, CI, and cleanup state.

Result states are fixed: `Pass` completed every named dimension; `Partial` ran some but not all required dimensions;
`Fail` observed a divergent result; `Blocked` attempted the row but required infrastructure prevented completion;
`Not run` means no required part was attempted. Only `Pass` satisfies a required row.

## Running And Recording Coverage

1. Collect every applicable requirement through the requested level from each affected feature document.
2. Preserve every named host, package, platform, runtime, lifecycle, and external-service matrix row.
3. Run focused lower-boundary checks before expensive actual-host or external checks.
4. Record `Pass`, `Partial`, `Fail`, `Blocked`, or `Not run`, including versions, boundary, matrix, variations,
   first divergent boundary, linked defects, and cleanup.
5. Keep only privacy-safe evidence. Never commit credentials, prompts, transcripts, comment bodies, raw logs,
   account identifiers, tokens, or local host configuration.

Clean up test PRs, labels, package installs, timers, sessions, and temporary configuration unless retained residue
is explicitly recorded for diagnosis. A summary such as "tests pass" is not evidence unless it identifies the
feature requirements and matrix row that those tests prove.

## Feature Maintenance

Add or update a feature file when product behavior, delivery, lifecycle, package contents, compatibility, or a known
limitation changes. Keep acceptance criteria fixed but avoid brittle click-by-click scripts. Feature files should
name the owning source/tests, highest level, proof boundary, and required host/platform matrix.

## Feature Index

- [`pull-request-monitoring.md`](pull-request-monitoring.md) — shared watch/activity/report semantics, autonomous
  ownership, ready-label handoff, host delivery/lifecycle, and configuration. Highest level: L5; primary boundaries:
  automated through packaged/external.
- [`plugin-installation.md`](plugin-installation.md) — OpenCode and Pi/OMP npm archives, Claude Git plugin root,
  exactly-once skill discovery, loader compatibility, release metadata, and publish order. Highest level: L5;
  primary boundaries: packaged/actual-host/external.

A behavior appearing in both files is not duplicate evidence: monitoring proves the runtime outcome, while
installation proves that the released artifact exposes the path capable of producing it.

## Durable Plan Retirement

A durable plan records its highest required level and complete matrix before implementation. Its final step runs
that exact coverage against the final merged source and records results in the tracker. Move a plan from
`.plan/active/` to `.plan/completed/` only after all required rows pass.

A reduction requires explicit user acceptance recorded in `PLAN.md`. `Partial`, `Blocked`, `Fail`, or `Not run`
required coverage keeps the plan active. If verification finds a production defect, merge a separately tracked
repair PR, rerun the affected checks plus the full retirement matrix, and retire only after both pass.
